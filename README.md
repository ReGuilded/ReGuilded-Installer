**ReGuilded Setup** is an easy installer for [ReGuilded](https://github.com/ReGuilded/ReGuilded).

## Executables
There are currently no executables for the ReGuilded Setup, as we are still working on it. We will create an executable when the setup/installer is ready to be released.
*We're currently working on creating an executable.*

## Testing/Development Builds
Currently, to test the setup you have to run `npm install` then `npm run app` this will open the electron app. Everything should be logged if there are any errors.

## Installing Upstream Version instead of Release.
By default, clicking the "ðŸ“¥ Install" will download the Latest Release. 
If you would like to install the Upstream version, hold your Left Shift key. 
The button will turn into "ðŸ“¥ Install (Dev)", clicking the button while holding shift, will download the Upstream Version.
